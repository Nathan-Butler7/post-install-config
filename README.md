<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)

<h2>Configuration Steps</h2>

In this lab exercise, we will alternate between the Admin Panel and the Agent Panel within the osTicket system. The Admin Panel is utilized for configuring system settings and managing backend operations, whereas the Agent Panel is designed for help desk personnel to access, manage, and respond to support tickets.

7. Configure SLA
The purpose of SLAs (Service Level Agreements) is to clearly define the expected level of service between a provider and a customer, including performance standards, responsibilities, and consequences if those standards arenâ€™t met. We are going to create 3 SLAs:

- Sev-C (Severity C - Lowest Priority) - (Grace Period: 8 hours, [Business Hours])

- Go to Admin Panel -> Manage -> SLA -> Add New SLA Plan.
